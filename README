In case I forget this, which I  always do, here's how to clone into ~ without mv'ing a bunch of stuff:

  cd
  git init
  git remote add origin remote_machine:~brentg/my_setup.git
  git fetch
  git branch master origin/master
  git checkout master

git probably won't overwrite files, so make sure the dir is clean first.
